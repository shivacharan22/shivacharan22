# About Me:
Hey, I am currently pursuing my Master’s degree in Artificial Intelligence at Boston University. I am curious about reinforcement learning concepts and multi-model AI, especially when applied to the dynamic and ever-evolving landscape of trading markets. I have experience in making RL agents for Vision Language tasks like navigation and interaction, SDN network protection in my projects and privacy decision-making for companies’ products as an AI research intern at Chipsil Tech. Also, have experience in making Deep learning and machine learning models in various competitions and projects including making a state-of-the-art hybrid DL model on the Stanford University mosquito wingbeat dataset,showcasing my commitment to pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in the field. I am driven by the desire to translate cutting-edge research findings into actionable insights and strategies that can navigate the complexities of financial markets. My relentless drive for innovation has led me to explore the intersection of AI and trading bots. If you have ideas or are interested in collaborating on implementing RL strategies for trading, I’m always eager to connect and discuss the possibilities. Let’s engage in a conversation that can potentially shape the future of AI.
