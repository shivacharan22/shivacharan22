# About Me:
I am advancing my specialization in Artificial Intelligence with a Master’s degree at Boston University, focusing on the intricacies of reinforcement learning and the exploration of multi-modal AI systems. My journey includes a rewarding stint as an AI research intern at ChipSil Technologies, where I played a pivotal role in pioneering research on chip design. There, I successfully developed and applied various neural network architectures integrated with reinforcement learning strategies. A notable highlight of my work was the creation of an innovative privacy policy decision-making system. This system, which utilized a decoder network and self-play reinforcement learning algorithms, proved the practical feasibility of our approach with a successful prototype.

My experience extends to crafting reinforcement learning agents for complex tasks such as vision-language navigation and interaction, protecting SDN networks, and developing advanced models for competitions and projects. This includes a state-of-the-art hybrid deep learning model for the Stanford University mosquito wingbeat dataset. Driven by a passion for turning research insights into tangible solutions, I’m keen on collaborating with individuals who are equally passionate about pushing the boundaries of AI.

Let’s connect and explore how we can drive progress in artificial intelligence together.
