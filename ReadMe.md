# About Me:
I'm Shiva, a Graduate MSc student in Artificial Intelligence at Boston University, engaged in building AI models at the H2X lab run by Prof. Eshed Ohn-Bar, as well as LLM reasoning alongside Prof. Dokyun Lee in BiT lab and their respective PhD students. 

In my professional and research experience, I have worked with various data types across multiple projects, demonstrating a broad spectrum of data handling and analysis capabilities. This includes legal policy documents, user interaction data, compliance performance metrics, open-source datasets such as GSM8K, CommonSenseQA, and HotpotQA for LLM reasoning, and extensive environmental visual datasets paired with textual instructions for vision-language navigation. Additionally, I have engaged with audio recordings for mosquito wingbeat frequencies, massive datasets of RGB-D images, navigation instructions totaling over a terabyte of data, and intricate stock market datasets. I've applied a broad range of algorithms and data analysis techniques to tackle complex challenges. From decoder networks and self-play reinforcement learning algorithms at Chipsil Technologies to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformer Encoders for classifying mosquito species, I've demonstrated a solid ability to adapt and innovate. My work with stock market data likely involved predictive modeling, time series analysis, and financial forecasting, showcasing my versatility and analytical prowess.

Let's connect and explore how we can drive progress in artificial intelligence together.
